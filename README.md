### Description

A "fluff" tool for usercontrol developers. With the attached, one can easily supply their own custom dropdown lists for propertysheets. If a property is a VB enumeration (say AlignmentConstants), you normally get values like: vbLeftJustify, vbRightJustify, vbCenter for the property's dropdown and its displayed value. Wouldn't it be cool if it was displayed like this instead: Left, Right, Centered? Easy. Ever want or need a string enumeration, say a list of controls on the form or a list of available drives? Easy. Want to display your own dialog box for a property vs a property sheet? Say a FileName property that opens a commondialog? Easy. The attached has a sample project that shows how this can be done. 18 Dec 08... Found memory related bugs that crash. Thunks &amp; mapped memory file modified as needed. Now tested compiled/uncompiled and in other apps (MSAccess). No more crashing; no errors noticed.
